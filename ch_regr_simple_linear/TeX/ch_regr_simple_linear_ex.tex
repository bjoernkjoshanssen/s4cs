\eoce{\qt{Extreme correlations}
	Give specific numerical examples of observations with
	\begin{parts}
		\item 
			$r = 1$
			
		\item
			$r = 0$
			
		\item
			$r = -1$
	\end{parts}
	\footnote{
		By ``specific numerical'' is meant that, for instance, $\{(1,2),(0,-3),(0,0)\}$ could be a possible answer --- although it will be wrong as $r$ will not be exactly 0, 1 or -1 for this particular choice!
	}

\eoce{\qt{Cauchy-Schwarz}
	Let $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n$ and $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ be real numbers.
	\begin{parts}
		\item 
			Rearrange the terms in $(u_1 x + v_1)^2 + (u_2 x + v_2)^2 + \dots + (u_n x + v_n)^2$ to obtain a quadratic polynomial $a x^2+b x+c$ in $x$.
		\item
			Note that the polynomial in part a has at most one real root and therefore that its discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is at most zero.
			Calculate this discriminant to conclude that
			$\left(\sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i \right)^2 \le \left(\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2\right) \left(\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2\right)$.
			This inequality (and its various generalizations) is known as the \textit{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}.
	\end{parts}

\eoce{\qt{Theory of extreme correlations}
	Let $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots (x_n, y_n)$ be observations.
	\begin{parts}
		\item 
			Show that 
			\[
				\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x} \frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}
				= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}
			\]
			Conclude that the term on the right is an equivalent formula for $r$.
		\item
			Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to $\left|\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y}) \right|$
			to conclude that $|r| \le 1$ and therefore that $-1 \le r \le 1$.
